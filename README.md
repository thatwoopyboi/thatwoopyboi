-  Hi, I’m @Thatwoopyboi
-  I’m interested in making Geometry Dash related things because why not? 
-  I’m currently learning the basics of Github as I haven't used it before.
-  I’m happy to collaborate with anyone who wants to and will come up with amazing ideas.

-  Wooper is the best and strongest being in the universe and whoever doesn't agree with me is going to be squished an pulverized into a burger and eaten by Wooper himself.
